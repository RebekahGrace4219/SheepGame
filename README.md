# Saber Sheep: An Evolutionary Journey

Saber Sheep is a basic JavaScript game that I programmed in highschool.  It follows basic Mendelian Genetics as you try to selectively breed your sheep to survive against oncoming disasters.  It can be played [here](https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/NYK9xbAL8M4be54wG3g5_Ddav618HSqOj4JsEwYKREg/view).
